Concept List
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network
  — the global system of interconnected computer networks from which we can access data.

Data
  — images, text, video, or any media that can be used by our apps.

Protocol
  — a way of communicating; standard operating procedure; the rules for communication

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
  — a protocol or “handshake” that defines how messages (and data) are sent
    and received by computers; the underlying protocol for the World Wide Web

Client
  — a computer that requests data (or services) from a server

Server
  — a computer that provides data (or services) to a client upon request

HTTP request
  — a request for data (or a resource) that a client makes to a server;
  there are various types of HTTP requests called “HTTP methods”

URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
  — specifies the location for retrieving data over the web;
  can be thought of as the name of a file on the World Wide Web,
  because it usually refers to a file on some machine on the network

HTTP method
  — specifies the type of HTTP request that is being made; in this course,
  we will also call these (HTTP) request types

HTTP status code
  — a number returned in response to an HTTP request which indicates the result
  of the request; you may also hear these referred to as “response codes” or
  “status messages." Here is a nice listing of different HTTP status codes.

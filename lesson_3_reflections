JSON Parsing Prep
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The key to parsing JSON is converting JSON types into usable Swift types.

JSON Example

{
  "first": "John",
  "last": "Smith",
  "age": 35,
  "employed": true,
  "hobbies": [
    "fishing",
    "bowling",
    "programming"
  ],
  "relatives": {
    "mother": "Susan",
    "father": "Eric",
    "siblings": null
  }
}

Notice, the above JSON is contained in curly braces {}.
This is indicative of a JSON Object type which translates nicely into a Swift
dictionary. Also notice, there is another JSON Object that is the value of the
"relatives" key.


JSON Types to Swift Types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a simple mapping JSON types to Swift types (JSON ==> Swift):

  null ==> nil
  Number ==> Int, Float, Double, ...
  String ==> String
  Boolean ==> Bool
  Array ==> [AnyObject]
  Object ==> [String:AnyObject]

Note the use of AnyObject for arrays and objects.
You will likely want a more specific type;
however, for safety, it is a good idea to start by parsing values as AnyObject
and then optionally casting them to more specific types.

Nesting of Objects (Dictionaries)

More complex JSON data sets will often embed objects into arrays.
This can look confusing at first, but it is actually quite simple.
Here is the Swift type that can represent this complex structure:

[[String:AnyObject]]
